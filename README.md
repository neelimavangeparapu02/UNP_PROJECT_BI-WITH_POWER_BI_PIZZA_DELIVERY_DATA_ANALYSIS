# UNP_PROJECT_BI-WITH_POWER_BI_PIZZA_DELIVERY_DATA_ANALYSIS

 I completed this project in collaboration with UNP.This project focuses on analyzing pizza delivery operations using Power BI to gain insights into order trends, delivery efficiency, and customer preferences. The dashboard highlights key metrics such as total orders, average delivery time, delay percentage, and peak ordering hours. It examines ordering patterns based on pizza size, type, payment method, and location to understand customer behavior. The analysis also evaluates delivery performance by identifying slow, normal, and fast deliveries under different traffic conditions. Additionally, the project provides insights into payment trends, showing the dominance of digital payments like UPI and cards. Overall, this dashboard helps improve operational efficiency, optimize delivery performance, and support better decision-making in pizza delivery services.
